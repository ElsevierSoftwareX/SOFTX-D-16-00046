CompSim is an open-source numerical model that computes the structural properties
of inhomogenious materials that have complex geometry. CompSim can be used as a complementary tool for trade-off studies in detailed design stage by providing initial design candidates. CompSim uses a weighted average technique combined with Eulerâ€“Bernoulli beam theory to extract the structural properties. Further details about the code can be found in:
